# 0xKYC-1VOTE-ARAGON_PLUGIN

# [DAO Global Hackathon](https://daoglobalhackathon.hackerearth.com/): [1st Place(4,000ðŸ’°) - Most Creative Use of OSx](https://blog.aragon.org/dao-global-hackathon-bounty-winners/)

## Overview

Our 1VOTE plugin aims to develop an innovative Proof of Uniqueness decision-making solution for Aragon OSx, enabling DAOs to easily adapt and evolve their governance mechanisms. Our Proof of Uniqueness is based on a biometric scan (selfie). After performing the selfie scan, we assign a unique identifier (UUID) to the user, and every additional instance of that user is minted with the same UUID. This approach connects users across wallets and allows protocols to implement mechanisms ensuring that each user has a single verified vote.

Currently, the system is not live. We plan to revive it using 0xKYCâ€™s technology, once a new facial biometrics system is installed and operational.

## Features

- Easy installation and uninstallation of decision-making plugins
- Customizable membership criteria for each governance protocol
- Proof of Uniqueness via ID & selfie scan to ensure one verified vote 
- Sanctions and AML screening

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/0xKYC/0xkyc-1vote-aragon-plugin
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
$ cd 0xkyc-1vote-aragon-plugin
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

4. Create .env file using .env.sample file:

```
ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY=
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=
GOERLI_INFURA_URL=
MUMBAI_INFURA_URL=
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=
```

5. Compile the contracts:

```
$ npx hardhat compile
```

6. Deploy the contracts:

```
$ npx hardhat deploy scripts/deploy.ts
```

7. Then, go to the PluginFactory contract on Etherscan and deploy the first version of your plugin
`https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x301868712b77744A3C0E5511609238399f0A2d4d#writeContract`

8. Access the plugin in the Aragon Subgraph by visiting and query: `https://subgraph.satsuma-prod.com/aragon/osx-goerli/playground`.

```
query GetPlugins {
  pluginRepos {
      subdomain
    }
}
```
